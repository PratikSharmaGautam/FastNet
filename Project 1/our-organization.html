        <h2><font color="black" size=5> With a dream of connecting everyone, anywhere, all the time,
         FastNet has been working dedicatedly to provide the best internet services to the Cetizens of Nepal.</h2> <br>
<p> <h4><font color="black" size=4> FastNet is the largest Internet and Network Service Provider in Nepal and one of the most prominent IT companies. 
Founded in august 2021 with the aim of providing Internet and IT services by its present Chairman and Managing 
Director Ashok Gurung, FastNet started off by providing store-and-forward e-mail services over a dial-up link to the Internet in the US.
 The continuous efforts to grow pushed the company to introduce full Internet access over a dedicated leased-line to the Internet backbone
  in the US through Teleglobe International.</p>  <br>

<p>FastNet has its state-of-the-art network built upon by the network equipment manufacturers like Nokia for DWDM, Juniper and
 Cisco for IP/MPLS Core and Aggregation, Extreme Network in Switching, Nokia and Huawei for the Access side. It operates one of
  the finest and the largest fiber backbone and access network across the country, serving 70 plus districts providing services 
  like high speed Internet up to 100Mbps along with HD IPTV services.</p> <br>
<div class="n">
<p> Over the 6 months, FastNet has become the most valuable brand in the IT industry of Nepal.
 The vision of the company to provide connectivity to all was joined by the CDC Group, UK's 
 development finance institution. At present CDC owns 10% of the company’s total share. FastNet has been 
 expanding its services to the rural portions of Nepal and to the remote villages. FastNet is working towards 
 availing internet to the under-privileged people staying in the remote areas thus bridging the great divide between
  the connected and not connected.</p> <br>

<p> FastNet has become a success story, the likes of which are usually found in the Silicon Valley. It has strengthened 
    its root in the overall IT sector in the small Himalayan country of Nepal. It has served its purpose of being a 
    role model for the IT startups for a long time now.It is creating many employments in the market and helping in
     making the country’s economy stronger.  In recognition of FastNet overall 
 contribution, Nepal Government has invited FastNet to be a part of IT taskforce such as National IT Infrastructure Development 
 Committee and contribute to the development of IT in the country.</p> <br>
